## Research Guidelines

1. **Work with what you have**: Even with just a URL, infer industry from domain name, common patterns, and any scraped data.

2. **Be specific, not generic**: "They probably struggle with manual data entry" is better than "They have operational challenges."

3. **Industry-specific insights**: Use your knowledge of industry pain points:
   - Healthcare: Compliance, patient data, scheduling
   - E-commerce: Inventory, customer service, personalization
   - SaaS: Churn, onboarding, support ticket volume
   - Manufacturing: Supply chain, quality control, maintenance
   - Professional Services: Billing, project management, knowledge management
   - Real Estate: Lead management, property matching, document processing

4. **Size estimation signals**:
   - Website sophistication
   - Team page presence
   - Office locations mentioned
   - Funding news (if known)
   - Job postings presence

5. **When uncertain**: State your confidence level. A "medium confidence" estimate is more useful than pretending certainty.
