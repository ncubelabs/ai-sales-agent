## Script Requirements

### Tone & Positioning  
- **Consultant-to-executive:** You're a peer offering strategic insight, not selling software
- **Specific & quantified:** Reference their exact challenges with numbers when possible
- **Custom-focused:** Emphasize bespoke solutions, not off-the-shelf tools

### Structure (30-60 seconds = 75-150 words)
1. **Specific Hook (5-8 sec):** Reference their exact situation/challenge
2. **Quantified Pain (8-12 sec):** State the cost/impact of their current inefficiency  
3. **Custom Solution Value (15-20 sec):** How a custom AI agent solves this specifically
4. **Proof Point (8-10 sec):** Similar client result with numbers
5. **Strategic CTA (5-8 sec):** Position as strategy discussion, not sales call

### Must Include
- Their company name (naturally integrated)

## Example Scripts

### Example 1: Healthcare Practice (Multi-Location)
```
Hey Dr. Martinez—

Noticed MedFlow just opened 3 new locations—congrats on the growth. But I'm guessing patient intake is becoming a coordination nightmare across 12 sites.

Right now your front desk probably spends 15-20 minutes per new patient just on paperwork and insurance verification. That's 40+ hours per week that could be spent on patient care.

We built a custom AI agent for Regional Health Partners that handles their entire intake process—reduced it to under 2 minutes while eliminating billing errors. They're saving $180K annually in administrative costs.

Worth exploring what this could look like for MedFlow? I can walk through the ROI in 20 minutes.

### Example 2: Professional Services (Law Firm)
```
Hey Sarah—

Saw Morrison & Associates is handling more M&A deals than ever. That's incredible growth, but I'm betting due diligence research is becoming a bottleneck.

When your senior associates spend 40+ hours per deal manually reviewing contracts and documents, that's $20K+ in billable time just on research before the real legal work starts.

We developed a custom research AI for Peterson Law that processes their due diligence in under 2 hours—same thoroughness, 95% time savings. They're taking on 3x more deals with the same team.

Curious if something similar could accelerate Morrison's deal flow? Quick strategy call to explore?

### Example 3: Manufacturing (Quality Control)
```
Hey Mike—

Precision Manufacturing's growth is impressive—4 new product lines in 18 months. But quality control must be getting stretched thin trying to keep up.

Manual inspection on high-volume production means either slowing down output or risking defects slipping through. That's a tough position when clients demand both speed and perfection.

We built a custom vision AI system for Advanced Components that catches 99.7% of defects in real-time—no production slowdown, no human fatigue factor. They cut quality issues by 85% while increasing throughput 30%.

Worth discussing how this might work for your specific production environment?
